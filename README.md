BBY Products Open API Search Tool
======

This project is a demo of the Best Buy (BBY) Products Open API. It was written as a simple demo of using Node.JS to make the search calls on the API.

This project is a Express/Jade/NodeJS application.

To run this project you'll need an API Key from http://Remix.BestBuy.com. Once you have that create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. Add the APIKey configuration to this file. For example:

```
APIKey=YOURSECRETAPIKEYGOESHERE12345
```
